# wallmicromouse
Micromouse is an event where small robotic mice compete to solve a 16Ã—16 maze. Our version of the micromouse is modified to use the design of the micromouse and utilize it's functionality for wall climbing, displaying the physics of air pressure.

# Purpose:
To make mundane daily tasks of accessing "wall" non-reachable objects easier to obtain.

Wall Micromouse will be made, if failed, back up would be normal Micromouse in which it finds the most optimal maze route using machine learning.
